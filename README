Very simple timer. It just shows seconds and can be adjusted in the interval from 1 second to 1 hour.


To build:
cmake -S timer -B /tmp/timer/release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=GlibToolChain.cmake

To install:
cmake --build /tmp/timer/release --config Release --target install DESTDIR=$HOME/.local
